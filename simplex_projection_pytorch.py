""" Module to compute projections on the positive simplex or the L1-ball

A positive simplex is a set X = { \mathbf{x} | \sum_i x_i = s, x_i \geq 0 }

The (unit) L1-ball is the set X = { \mathbf{x} | || x ||_1 \leq 1 }

def euclidean_proj_simplex(v, s=1):
    """ Compute the Euclidean projection on a positive simplex

    Solves the optimisation problem (using the algorithm from [1]):

        min_w 0.5 * || w - v ||_2^2 , s.t. \sum_i w_i = s, w_i >= 0 

    Parameters
    ----------
    v: (n,) numpy array,
       n-dimensional vector to project

    s: int, optional, default: 1,
       radius of the simplex

    Returns
    -------
    w: (n,) numpy array,
       Euclidean projection of v on the simplex

    Notes
    -----
    The complexity of this algorithm is in O(n log(n)) as it involves sorting v.
    Better alternatives exist for high-dimensional sparse vectors (cf. [1])
    However, this implementation still easily scales to millions of dimensions.
